# Amazon Alexa Smart Home Skill
Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon and designed to run on smart speakers and devices such as the Amazon Echo and Dot. This certified Amazon Smart Home Skill allows users to naturally control their openHAB powered smart home with natural voice commands.  

This page describes how to use the [openHAB Alexa Smart Home Skill](https://www.amazon.com/openHAB-Foundation/dp/B01MTY7Z5L).
The skill connects your openHAB setup through the [myopenHAB.org](http://myopenHAB.org) cloud service to Amazon Alexa.
(See [the skill README](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-alexa/blob/master/README.md) for other setup options and development information.)

## Requirements

* [openHAB Cloud Connector](http://docs.openhab.org/addons/ios/openhabcloud/readme.html) configured using myopenHAB.org
* Amazon account
* Amazon Echo, Amazon Echo Dot or compatible Alexa device

## Setup

* NEW Alexa Version 3 API syntax (v3)
  * Version 3 of the Alex Skill API introduces a more rich and complex set of features that required a change in how items are configured by using the new metadata feature introduced in openaHAB 2.3
  * Version 2 tags are still supported and are converted internally to V3 meta data
  * See [Label Support](#Label-Support) for using labels in item tags and meta data.

### Item Label Recommendation

Matching of voice commands to Items happens based on the Item label (e.g. "Kitchen Light"). It is therefore advisable, to choose labels that can be used to form natural commands. As an example, compare "Alexa, turn on the Kitchen Light" vs. "Alexa, turn on the Ground Floor LEDs Kitchen".

### Item Configuration

The Alexa skill API uses the concept of "endpoints".  Endpoints are addressable entities that expose functionality in the form of capability interfaces.  An example endpoint may be a light switch, which has a single capability called power state (ON/OFF).  A more complex endpoint may be a thermostat which has many capabilities to control and report temperature, setpoints, modes, etc..

### Item State

Item states, reported back to Alexa, are formatted based on their [item state presentation](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/items.html#state-presentation) definition if configured. This means you can control the precision of number values (e.g. `%.1f Â°C` will limit reported temperature value to one decimal point).

#### Single items
Single items in openHAB can be mapped to single endpoint in Alex through the use of the Alexa metadata.

An simple example of this is a light switch. In openHAB a light switch is defined as a "Switch" item and responds to ON or OFF commands.
```
Switch LightSwitch "Light Switch"
```
In the Alexa skill a light switch endpoint implements the "PowerController" interface and exposes a "powerState" property. To map our openHAB switch to a PowerController endpoint we use a Alexa metadata:
```
Switch LightSwitch "Light Switch" {alexa="PowerController.powerState"}
```
Setting this on a single item will create an Alexa endpoint with the spoken addressable name "Light Switch" and map the powerState property to our item. You can ask Alexa to turn "Light Switch" on or off.

A slightly more complex example would be a Light Dimmer.  In openHAB a dimmer object responds to both percentage and ON / OFF commands.  In Alexa this is two different interfaces.  To support both types of commands, we need to add both to the item metadata:
```
Dimmer LightSwitch "Light Switch" {alexa="PowerController.powerState,BrightnessController.brightness"}
```

You can ask Alexa to "Turn Light Switch .." on or off as well as "Set Light Switch to .." a certain percentage.

NOTE: the Alexa skill has 3 different percentage interfaces, BrightnessController, PowerLevelController and PercentageController.  Your item should only be using one of these that best describes the type of device.  So for lights this would be the BrightnessController, for roller shades this would be PercentageController.   The skill will not prevent adding more then one, but voice control may suffer for that device.

#### Group Items

While single mapping items works for many use cases, occasionally multiple openHAB items need to be mapped to a single endpoint in Alex.

For this example we will use 2 different use cases, a thermostat and a stereo.

In openHAB a thermostat is modeled as many different items, typically there are items for set points (target, heat, cool), modes, and the current temperature. To map these items to a single endpoint in Alexa, we will add them to a group which also uses "Alexa" metadata. When items are alexa-enabled, but are also a member of a group alexa-enabled, they will be added to the group endpoint and not exposed as their own endpoints.

```
  Group  Thermostat    "Bedroom"                                {alexa="Endpoint.Thermostat"}
  Number Temperature   "Temperature [%.0f F]"    (Thermostat)   {alexa="TemperatureSensor.temperature"}
  Number HeatSetpoint  "Heat Setpoint [%.0f F]"  (Thermostat)   {alexa="ThermostatController.upperSetpoint"}
  Number CoolSetpoint  "Cool Setpoint [%.0f F]"  (Thermostat)   {alexa="ThermostatController.lowerSetpoint"}
  Number Mode          "Mode [%s]"               (Thermostat)   {alexa="ThermostatController.thermostatMode"}
  ```

  The group metadata also describes the category for the endpoint, in this case a "Thermostat".  See the section below on Group mapping metadata and categories for a complete list.  In this example a single endpoint is created called "Bedroom", its various interfaces are mapped to different openHAB items.  You can ask Alexa "Set the Bedroom heat to 72" and the 'HeatSetpoint' will receive the command, likewise you can ask Alexa "What's the temperature of the Bedroom" and Alexa will query the 'Temperature' items for its value.

  When mapping items, sometime we need to pass additional parameters to Alexa to set things like what scale to use (Fahrenheit) or what values our items expect for certain states (thermostat modes). These parameters can be passed in the metadata properties, if they are omitted, then reasonable defaults are used.  In our above example we may wish to use Fahrenheit as our temperature scale, and map the mode strings to numbers.  This would look like:

```
  Group  Thermostat    "Thermostat"                             {alexa="Endpoint.Thermostat"}
  Number Temperature   "Temperature [%.0f F]"    (Thermostat)   {alexa="TemperatureSensor.temperature" [scale="Fahrenheit"]}
  Number HeatSetpoint  "Heat Setpoint [%.0f F]"  (Thermostat)   {alexa="ThermostatController.upperSetpoint" [scale="Fahrenheit"]}
  Number CoolSetpoint  "Cool Setpoint [%.0f F]"  (Thermostat)   {alexa="ThermostatController.lowerSetpoint" [scale="Fahrenheit"]}
  Number Mode          "Mode [%s]"               (Thermostat)   {alexa="ThermostatController.thermostatMode" [OFF=0,HEAT=1,COOL=2,AUTO=3]}
  ```

  A Stereo is another example of a single endpoint that needs many items to function properly.  Power, volume, input, speakers and player controllers are all typical use cases for a stereo that a user may wish to control.

```
  Group Stereo    "Stereo"            {alexa="Endpoint.Speaker"}
  Number Volume   "Volume"  (Stereo)  {alexa="Speaker.volume"}
  Switch Mute     "Mute"    (Stereo)  {alexa="Speaker.muted"}
  Switch Power    "Power"   (Stereo)  {alexa="PowerController.powerState"}
  String Input    "Input"   (Stereo)  {alexa="InputController.input"}
  String Channel  "Channel" (Stereo)  {alexa="ChannelController.channel"}
  Player Player   "Player"  (Stereo)  {alexa="PlaybackController.playback"}
  ```

* Item Scale
  * With the introduction of the [unit of measurement](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/units-of-measurement.html) concept, the item scale can be automatically determined for thermostat and temperature using that feature, removing the need of having to set a metadata scale parameter for each of the relevant items or groups.
  * Below are two examples; the scale on the first will be set to Fahrenheit based on how it is defined in the item state presentation pattern and the second one will be set based on your openHAB system regional settings (US=Fahrenheit; SI=Celsius).

  `Number:Temperature Temperature1 "Temperature [%.1f Â°F]" {alexa="TemperatureSensor.temperature"}`
  `Number:Temperature Temperature2 "Temperature"           {alexa="TemperatureSensor.temperature"}`
* Item Sensor
  * When available, use a specific item (called "sensor") for property state reporting over the actionable item state.
  * Design to bridge channel status items to provide improved reporting state accuracy.
  * Configured by adding the `itemSensor=<itemName>` metadata parameter.
  * Sensor items need to be the same type than their parent item, except for LockController capable items.
* Item Categories
  * Alexa has certain categories that effect how voice control and their mobile/web UI's display or control endpoints.  An example of this is when you create "Smart Device Groups" in the Alex app and associate a specific Echo or Dot to that Group (typically a room).  When a user asks to turn the lights ON, Alexa looks for devices in that group that have the category "LIGHT" to send the command to.  
  * You can override this default value on items by adding it as a parameter to the metadata, ex:

  `Switch LightSwitch "Light Switch" {alexa="PowerController.powerState" [category="OTHER"]}`
  * List of Alexa categories currently supported from [Alexa Skill API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/device-apis/alexa-discovery.html#display-categories) docs:

Category	| Description	| Notes
---------|-------------|-------
ACTIVITY_TRIGGER	| Describes a combination of devices set to a specific state, when the state change must occur in a specific order. |For example, a "watch Netflix" scene might require the: 1. TV to be powered on & 2. Input set to HDMI1.	| Applies to Scenes
CAMERA	| Indicates media devices with video or photo capabilities.	 
CONTACT_SENSOR | Indicates an endpoint that detects and reports changes in contact between two surfaces.
DOOR	| Indicates a door.	 
DOORBELL | Indicates a doorbell.
LIGHT	| Indicates light sources or fixtures.
MICROWAVE | Indicates a microwave oven endpoint.	 
MOTION_SENSOR | Indicates an endpoint that detects and reports movement in an area.
OTHER	| An endpoint that cannot be described in on of the other categories.	 
SCENE_TRIGGER	|Describes a combination of devices set to a specific state, when the order of the state change is not important. For example a bedtime scene might include turning off lights and lowering the thermostat, but the order is unimportant.	| Applies to Scenes
SMARTLOCK	| Indicates an endpoint that locks.	 
SMARTPLUG	| Indicates modules that are plugged into an existing electrical outlet.	| Can control a variety of devices.
SPEAKER	| Indicates the endpoint is a speaker or speaker system.

THERMOSTAT	| Indicates endpoints that control temperature, stand-alone air conditioners, or heaters with direct temperature control.	 
TV	| Indicates the endpoint is a television.	 

#### Supported Group mapping metadata
* Functional groups (no group type) can be labelled with one of Alexa categories listed above. It can be set using one of the two formats: `Endpoint.<category>` or `<category>`
* Example `{alexa="Endpoint.Thermostat"}` or `{alexa="Thermostat"}`
* Child item categories are ignored and only the group category is used on items.
* Case is ignored on the category part of the metadata and any value will be made all uppercase before its passed to the Alexa API.

#### Label Support
Item tags and metadata labels translate to a set of capabilities and can be usesd as a convenience to using the longer meta data format configuration.  These are the same as v2 tags but add additional functions and provide the ability to add customization through additional properties which take precedence over the default ones. Here are some examples:
```
Switch OutletPlug "Outlet Plug" {alexa="Switchable" [category="SMARTPLUG"]}
Switch TelevisionPower "Television Power" {alexa="Switchable" [category="TV"]}

Color LightColor "Light Color" {alexa="Lighting"}
```

### Version 2 Item mapping
  * Items are exposed via Homekit tags, the following is taken from the homekit binding in openHAB2:

  ```
  Switch KitchenLights "Kitchen Lights" <light> (gKitchen) [ "Lighting" ]
  Dimmer BedroomLights "Bedroom Lights" <light> (gBedroom) [ "Lighting" ]
  Number BedroomTemperature "Bedroom Temperature" (gBedroom) [ "CurrentTemperature" ]
  Group gDownstairsThermostat "Downstairs Thermostat" (gFF) [ "Thermostat" ]
  Number DownstairsThermostatCurrentTemp "Downstairs Thermostat Current Temperature" (gDownstairsThermostat) [ "CurrentTemperature" ]
  Number DownstairsThermostatTargetTemperature "Downstairs Thermostat Target Temperature" (gDownstairsThermostat) [ "TargetTemperature" ]
  String DownstairsThermostatHeatingCoolingMode "Downstairs Thermostat Heating/Cooling Mode" (gDownstairsThermostat) [ "homekit:HeatingCooling" ]
  ```

  * Thermostats are created by adding the items of a thermostat to a group which has the tag "Thermostat" which follows the HomeKit binding configuration. See the [HomeKit binding documentation](http://docs.openhab.org/addons/ios/homekit/readme.html) for more information on how to configure thermostats. Thermostats can have their target temperature set as well as be asked what the current temperature is.
  * Channels which are tagged "CurrentTemperature" but NOT part of a thermostat group will be exposed as a Temperature item in Alexa and can be asked what their current value is ("Alex what is the upstairs temperature? ")
  * By default all temperatures are in Celsius, for Fahrenheit add the tag `Fahrenheit` to the thermostat group item (which should also be tagged with `Thermostat`).  For standalone temperature channels, add it directly to the item.
  * In addition you can tag Rollershutter items by `[ "Switchable" ]` and get support for `setPercentage`, `incrementPercentage`and `decrementPercentage` commands. Example:

  ```
  Rollershutter Shutter_GF_Kitchen "Rollershutter Kitchen" [ "Switchable" ]
  ```

  * With commands like `Alexa, set rollershutter kitchen to 100%` you control the rollershutter in the kitchen.
  * If your rollershutters or blinds happen not to support aperture by percentage the following rule helps to achieve opening and closing:

  ```
  rule Rollershutter_Kitchen
  when
      Item Shutter_GF_Kitchen received command
  then
      if (receivedCommand < 50) { // in germany alexa often recognizes "0" as "9"
        sendCommand(Shutter_GF_Kitchen, UP)
      } else {
        sendCommand(Shutter_GF_Kitchen, DOWN)
      }
  end
  ```

## Example Voice Commands

Here are some example voice commands:

 * Alexa turn on Office Lights
 * Alexa turn off Pool Waterfall
 * Alexa turn on House Fan
 * Alexa turn on Home Theater Scene
 * Alexa dim Kitchen Lights to 30 percent
 * Alexa set house temperature to 70 degrees
