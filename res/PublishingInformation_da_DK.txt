Short Skill Description:
Voice controls for your openHAB home automation controller


Full Skill Description:
An openHAB (Open Home Automation Bus) Skill, which allows your Amazon Echo(s) to securely control your devices.
openHAB is different than other HA solutions in that it is completely vendor-neutral, hardware/protocol-agnostic, provides multiple user interfaces and is free and open source.

Please note that to use this Skill it is required that:

 * You have deployed and configured an openHAB server
 * You are using the openHAB Cloud binding and cloud service
 * openHAB2 items must use voice tags to expose items.

Here are some example voice commands:

 * Turn on Office Lights
 * Turn off Pool Waterfall
 * Turn on House Fan
 * Turn on Home Theater Scene
 * Dim Kitchen Lights to 30 percent
 * Set house temperature to 70 degrees
